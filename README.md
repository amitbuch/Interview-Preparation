Resources for Technical and Behavioral Interviews

## I used multiple resources to prepare for Data Structures and Algorithm based technical interviews.

The Youtube and Udemy have helped me a lot learnign this paradigm. Being a physicist, many of these were not tought to me in a class setting, so I had to invest myself in learning and practicing thse.

Its hard work and time consuming endeavor so one must start this sooner. Although we are approaching the LLMs and CoPilots for initial code generation based on prompts, we are going to have to use these to get through the interviews.

I compare this skill to martial arts, where constant practice keeps you fir and ready for any situation. Consider yourself as a martial artist, trying to survice brutal waves of layoff attacks, where these skills guarantee your survival.
