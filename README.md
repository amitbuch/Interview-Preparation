### Job-Interview-Preparation
Resources for Technical and Behavioral Interviews

### I used multiple resources to prepare for Data Structures and Algorithm based technical interviews.

The Youtube and Udemy have helped me a lot learning this paradigm. Being a physicist, many of these were not tought to me in a class setting, so I had to invest myself in learning and practicing these.

Its hard work and time consuming endeavor, so one must start this sooner. Although we are approaching the 21st centuary code development through LLMs and CoPilots, we are going to have to use these to get through the interview processes.

I compare this skill to martial arts, where constant practice keeps you fit and ready for any situation. Consider yourself a martial artist, trying to survice brutal waves of "layoff attacks", where these skills guarantee your survival.

### My inspirations :
Folloing authors have helped me learn this skill and I feel indebted to them.


- Step 1 : Udemy : Elshad Karimov Course - Best for novice starter. Long but through introduction to this topic.
- Step 2 : Youtube : Neetcode.io author. This website is invaluable one you finished the initial course above. Follow his step by step learning path.

Next move to Leetcode, HackerRank whatever interests and challenges you.
